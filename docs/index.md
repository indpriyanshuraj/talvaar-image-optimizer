# Talvaar Image Optimizer - Code Implementation

> This documentation was generated by Google Gemini 2.5.

Welcome to the technical documentation for the Talvaar Image Optimizer. This document provides a high-level overview of the project's architecture, code flow, and module dependencies.

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with a modular architecture to separate concerns, making it easier to test, maintain, and extend. The core logic resides within the `resizer_module` package, with a simple `main.py` acting as the entry point.

The main components are:

- **`main.py` (Entry Point)**: The script you run. Its only job is to import and call the main CLI function.
- **`resizer_module/` (Core Package)**:
    - **`cli.py`**: Handles all user interaction, including parsing command-line arguments (`argparse`) and running the interactive questionnaire (`rich`). This module is the main orchestrator.
    - **`worker.py`**: Contains the `process_single_image` function, which is the core pipeline for processing one image. It's designed to be run in a separate process via `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
    - **`analysis.py`**: Contains functions to analyze an image's properties, such as transparency type and color count, to suggest optimization strategies.
    - **`optimizer.py`**: Implements the "smart" optimization logic. It takes an image and an analysis report, then tests various saving methods in memory to find the one that produces the smallest file size without sacrificing necessary features (like transparency).
    - **`utils.py`**: A small collection of helper functions used across the application.
- **`tests/` (Testing Suite)**: A package containing unit tests for each module to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
